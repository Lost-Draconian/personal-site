			<h3>Cooking</h3>
		  <p>I love cooking because I w always feel accomplished making a good dinner. I am always helping around the kitchen when dinner is being made and sometimes I am making dinner my self. I started cooking dinner because my mother started working more, which meant that she'd come home tired and would get me to make dinner and from there I learned the joys of cooking</p>

		  <h3>Patience</h3>
		  <p>I am extremely patient. I see patience as something that will et you farther in life than trying to make things happen ever will. I learned patience through my mother. She always told me to be patient, and whenever I was she rewarded me for it and that has gotten me pretty far so far.</p>
